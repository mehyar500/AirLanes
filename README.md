(Currently working on updates --- passport removed temporary and other features)

This application will connect private jet owners with consumers looking to avoid the commerical airline hassle. The private jet owners will add their planes to the database, while the consumers will be able to search through our databases. When the consumer finds the flight they are looking for, they are able to book the flight.
